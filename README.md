3. Orchestration Store
4. Gatekeeper and Gateway settings

Running this project has 3 options:

1. Running from prebuilt Docker container
2. Running and building the project by source code

### Docker image

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. [Pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) the prebuilt docker image:

   ```
   svetlint/management-tool
   ```

   Available tags:

3. [Run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) the container with the following example command:
   ```
   docker run -it -p 3000:5000
   --name management-tool
   -e ARROWHEAD_SR_URL=http://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8342
   -e ARROWHEAD_ORCH_URL=http://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8340
   -e ARROWHEAD_GK_URL=http://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8348
   svetlint/management-tool
   ```

### Running the project in development mode

1. The project requires [NodeJS v7 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Check your node version with the following command:

   ```
   node -v
   ```

3. Download or check out this project, go to the root folder and execute the following command, to install all dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root folder based on `.env.example` (all environment values are listed in the example)
5. Start the development server with the following command
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Available environment variables

You can use the following environment variables in the `.env` file, or in the docker run command with the `-e` flag.
However, skip the `REACT_APP_` prefix of each variable if using docker.

    ```
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_SR_URL=URL:port of your Service Registry Core System
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_ORCH_URL=URL:port of your Orchestrator Core System
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_GK_URL=URL:port or your Gatekeeper Core System
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_AUTH_URL=URL:port of your Authorization Core System
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_EH_URL=URL:port of your Event Handler Core System
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_CHOREOGRAPHER_URL=URL:port of your Choreographer Core System
    ```

Example environment variables, for the BME public test beds

    ```
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_SR_URL=https://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8443
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_AUTH_URL=https://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8445
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_ORCH_URL=https://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8441
    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_GK_URL=https://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8449

    REACT_APP_ARROWHEAD_EH_URL=https://arrowhead.tmit.bme.hu:8455
    ```

## Keycloak

For user management you have the option to use [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). If you wish to use it, it is expect you to have the basic knowledge how to set it up.
Management Tool with out of the box Keycloak compatibility can be found in the [keycloak branch](https://github.com/arrowhead-tools/mgmt-tool-js/tree/keycloak).

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Q: When I start the Management Tool all pages are blank. :( What should I do?
A: Either you missed to provide the correct environment variables (.env using Node or -e flag using Docker), or you've made a typo.

Q: I am facing an issue, which is not listed here :( What should I do?
A: Open an issue with a detailed description.
